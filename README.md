# Todolist React + Django based app

This project was built by React, Chakra UI, Effector JS, Apollo GraphQL Client for the frontend side and built by Django, MongoDB, Graphene for the backend side. I'm not deploy it to any of the cloud services, so there's no live demo from this app. Feel free to copy and modify for personal usage.
